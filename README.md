A 2D Game Engine being developed in C.

The goal behind this project is to learn as much as possible about low level programming, getting into the inner workings of many libraries, to learn how things actually work.

Currently Implemented:
* WIN32 Renderer, and Application support
* GameObject Buffer/Pool
* Structs for GameObject, World, CollisionBox, Shape, Pose
* A main engine loop encorperating all of this

Currently Developing:
* Linux Renderer, and Application support using XDG for X11 systems
* A big refactor of the World and Renderer system to allow for Multiple window instances with Worlds tied to each instance
